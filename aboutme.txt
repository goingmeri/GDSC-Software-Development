Hello! o( ˶^▾^˶ )o My name is Mary Jean D. Navarro. 
I prefer to be called Mer. 
It's a nickname that I've been using for a while now.
My course is Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, from Year 1 Section 1.
I'm just starting out, but I'm eager to learn and improve every day!
Let’s Go Software Development Team! (∩˃o˂∩)♡
